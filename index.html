          Interested in using data to make a mark in the environmental
          conservation industry
        </h3>
        <p>
          As a graduate of the University of California, Santa Barbara with a
          Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Studies, I was passionate about
          courses such as: Environmental law, and Coastal Resources and
          Management. These courses sparked an interest in how we use science
          and law to do our part in mitigating the effects of climate change on
          the planet. I wish to build upon this knowledge and develop a career
          that uses data science, environmental science, conservation
          restoration, and sustainability to manage the effects of climate
          change.
