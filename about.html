        <h3>Traveling</h3>
        <img src="Broome.jpeg" alt="Broome" />
        <p>
          Vietnam 2019: I toured north and south Vietnam with my family. I
          experienced Vietnam's cold, foggy mountain climate as well as the hot,
          sweltering rice paddies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Australia 2019: I studied abroad in Australia for 5 months and was
          based out of Melbourne. On my spare time, I traveled to Sydney, camped
          in a van through Tasmania, and snorkeled the Great Barrier Reef with
          my friends. Then I solo traveled to the Whitsundays, visiting its
          white, sandy beaches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Washington 2021: My sister, cousin, and I ventured to Washington to
          experience the city (and especially coffee) of Seattle. We had a blast
          eating oysters and hiking through Mount Rainier.
        </p>
        <p>
          Australia 2022: I returned to Australia in 2022 for a big solo trip. I
          planned to finish the rest of the continent that I hadn't seen the
          first time and found myself constantly on the move. I started in
          Uluru, where I walked the red country and gazed at the stars. I flew
          over to Tasmania and sailed around the Tasman Peninsula and witness
          Australia's tallest sea cliffs. I then flew to Sydney where I met up
          with a friend before flying over to a small beach town on the other
          side of the country. Its name was Broome and I rode camels on the
          beach at sunset and saw vibrant, red sand beaches. I took a break from
          the country and flew over to Adelaide for some wine tasting and then
          hopped over to Queensland and visited Noosa.
        </p>
        <p>
          New Zealand 2024: My next travel destination will be New Zealand! I
          hope to visit end of 2024 but we will see what life throws at me.

        <h3>Plant Care</h3>
        <img src="Plants.jpeg" alt="plants" />
        <p>
          The pandemic was when I entered the plant community. I started off
          with a small desk plant and quickly got so into it that I ended up
          with 35 plants in the following 3 years. I dabbled into aroids, hoyas,
          cacti, and even carnivorous plants. I swear, the air in my bedroom
          never smelled fresher.
